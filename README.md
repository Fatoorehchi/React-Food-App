# React-Food-App
A small project to practise my React skills.

    -hooks used: useState, useContext, useEffect 
    -Manage of the props with useContext
    -fetch to get the recipes from an API (https://api.spoonacular.com)
    -React router to handle the routing
    -Material ui for the design

Then : -npm install

and finaly : -npm start
